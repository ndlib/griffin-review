The University Libraries cannot take responsibility for loss or damage to personal copies of materials placed on reserve.</p><p>To aid in identification and for circulation purposes, each personal copy of a book or article placed on reserve will have a barcode attached to it. These barcodes will be easy to remove to insure no damage is done on our part For items designated as &quot;Library Use Only&quot;, our staff will attach a slip to the cover of the book which will indicate that the item is to remain in the library.</p><p>At the end of the academic semester, unless our staff has been notified otherwise, we will return any personal copies to you through campus mail. If you have a large number of items on reserve we then ask that you pick up your personal copies at the Reserve desk.
